## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Inamarie84/holidaze.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd holidaze

```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

4. Run the development server: (http://localhost:3000)

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Environment

Create a `.env.local` in the project root:

```bash
# Base Noroff v2 API (no trailing slash)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://v2.api.noroff.dev

```

## üåê API usage

All data comes from the Noroff v2 API (Holidaze).
Common calls:

- Venues (list): /holidaze/venues?page=&limit=&\_bookings=true
- Venue (by id): /holidaze/venues/:id?\_bookings=true&\_owner=true
- Profiles (self): /holidaze/profiles/:username
- Bookings (self): /holidaze/profiles/:username/bookings?\_venue=true
- Manager CRUD: /holidaze/venues (requires auth + venueManager)

The app uses a small helper wrapper to:

- Hydrate Authorization from session when needed
- Optionally include X-Noroff-API-Key
- Parse and normalize errors into friendly messages

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## üîê Auth & session

- Login/register calls save { token, user } to the Zustand store.
- The store is persisted in localStorage so you stay logged in across reloads.
- AuthGate and SessionHydrator ensure the UI doesn‚Äôt flicker before the session is rehydrated.
